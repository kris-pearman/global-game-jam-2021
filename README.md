Help a drunk, homeless artist rediscover their life’s memories through lost paintings. Navigating an atmospheric city while battling the influences of a drunken stupor, you’ll guide the artist on a search for remnants of their own paintings. With each piece of artwork found, the artist comes one step closer to unlocking their forgotten inspiration, the glimpse of a newfound hope growing steadily brighter in front of them.
